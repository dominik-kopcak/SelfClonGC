This repo contains simulation data, SLiM and R code as a supplement to the paper at bioRChive: URL

constant sh refers to a model in which all mutations have the same selection and dominance coefficient
non-constant sh refers to a model in which selection and dominance coefficeint of each mutation is drawn from some distribution of values
