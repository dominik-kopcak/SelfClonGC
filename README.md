<center> <h1> How do self-fertilising with facultative sexual populations differ in mutation accumulation? </h1> </center>

This repo contains simulation data, SLiM and R code as a supplement to the paper.

constant sh refers to a model in which all mutations have the same selection and dominance coefficient
non-constant sh refers to a model in which selection and dominance coefficeint of each mutation is drawn from some distribution of values

'conda_environment.yml' is a yml file from which a conda environment can be built, which contains all dependencies for these simulations and their analysis
